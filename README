This is the culmination of 1 hours work after an idea popped into my head for creating a quick to apply set of reusable compenents.

There is a heck of a lot to do. What I have started is probably NOT the best approach, which is why im reaching out to the community now.
Please help me make a bootstrap for the titanium community. Pull request to your hearts content. 

What next?

The grid is layed out. Proof of concept works. My aim is to work through the Bootstrap website/CSS top down, creating components like for like.

The rest is open for discussion.


First major TODO: chainable functions. I want to be able to write:

window.add(container.row.span1.add(p('Text'));

Again, my starter attempts will not allow for this right now. Needs reorganisation.
